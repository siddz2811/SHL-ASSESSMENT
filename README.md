### Whole application is succesfully running on local servers , clone github repo and run it in your server using ur own api keys.
### Kindly use your own groq,pinecone,huggingface api token for security reasons<br>
### 1 Ran my application,API Endpoints successfully on local machine successfully, had problems during cloud deployment<br>
### 2 rag_api_fastapi.py contains API endpoints running successfully basically the whole backend<br>
### 3 webapp codes folder has codes html,css,javascript codes for web application that is running successfully locally<br>
### 4 Result Images contains images of successfully running api endpoint and web app code , if possible kindly refer to it<br>
### 5 CRAWL.IPYNB displays how the data was extracted from SHL Product catalog to shl_individual_test.csv which was then used in our rag application<br>
### 6 TrainData123.xlsx shows the results of our model on the training dataset of Gen_AI Dataset.xlsx<br>
### 7 Testdata11.csv shows results of our model on the test set of Gen_AI Dataset.xlsx <br>
### 8 EEEEvaluations_Recall@K.xlsx shows recall results of each query that ran on the training dataset.<br>
### 9 ragss.ipynb <br>
It is a Jupyter Notebook providing an interactive environment for developing and testing the RAG workflow for assessment recommendation.<br>
It allows experimentation with different data sources, embedding models, retrieval strategies, and prompt engineering—all within a notebook interface.<br>
The test-set.csv,eeevaluation.csv file all was generated here<br>
Contains the whole structure of the code which was basically then modularized into rag_api_fastapi.py for further developing API endpoints.
